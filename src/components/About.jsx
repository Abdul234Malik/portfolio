              I'm a passionate Full Stack & AI developer with over 1 year of experience building
              modern web applications. My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how
              things work and has evolved into a career dedicated to creating innovative
              solutions that make a real impact.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I love
              working on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible
              on the web, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.

            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open source projects,
               I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.
